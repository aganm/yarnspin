Introduction
------------

Yarnspin is a simple story-telling engine, with its own built-in scripting language and graphics processing, turning hi-res photos into palettized low-res pixels.

There is a custom script language, which allows you to define dialogs with options, and set up locations with descriptions and images. 

Yarnspin games runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and in browsers.
