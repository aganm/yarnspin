john: Did I hear someone say Art? That happens to be my specialty.
john: I know a lot of people feel that they don't have any artistic talent. I don't believe that for a moment! Anyone can learn to draw, you just need to practice it.

=== sourcing_images ===

john: Well, you don't absolutely have to use images, it is perfectly fine to make a text-only game as well.
john: You could also use photographs, ones you take yourself or ones that you download - there are plenty of images available that are free to use for your games. But remember, not every image you find is ok to use - you must have the proper permission. And if you use a photo of a person, you need permission from both the photographer and the person in the photo.

john: So if you want to find pictures to use for locations, I recommend looking at places like www.pixabay.com (all pictures there are public domain), www.opengameart.org or commons.wikimedia.org. But note that you can't use photos of people, without their specific permission.

=== sourcing_images_ai ===

john: While it is definitely possible to use AI image generators to make pictures for your game, it is important to be aware of the various issues with generative AI. 
john: There are both legal and ethical issues with using AI (and with how AI training data is acquired) and these things change at a very fast pace.
john: Before considering the use of AI images, it is a good idea to learn about those issues, and form an opinion about if and how you feel comfortable using AI.
