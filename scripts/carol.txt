carol: Oh hello! Can you guess what we are doing right now?
player: I... what?
carol: We are having a dialog!
carol: Dialogs are a very important concept in Yarnspin. Along with Locations, they make up the majority of the game.
carol: Dialogs are made up of phrases which are spoken by a character, and Options, which the player can choose among. You can also use Items in a dialog.

act: carol_options


=== about_dlg_items ===

carol: I want to know more about items too! But I am not so familiar with them, I just know they can be used in dialogs as well as in locations. If you ask around the place, I am sure someone can tell you more about them.
